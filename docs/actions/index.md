# Github Actions

KSPBuildTools provides several composite actions for use with Github Actions. These are smaller units of tasks that can be combined in workflows to help automate testing, building, and releasing mods.

For usage, see [Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-pre-written-building-blocks-in-your-workflow) in the
Github docs.
