# Github Workflows

KSPBuildTools provides several reusable workflows for use with Github Actions. These are full-blown workflows that can be triggered from your own repository on certain events.

For usage, see [Reusing Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows) in the Github docs.
